# AGENTS.md — builder-cap2UI5-web

Guidance for AI agents and contributors. Read before making any change.

## What this repo is

The **browser build tooling** for cap2UI5: it mirrors the deployable app
repo [cap2UI5/cap2UI5](https://github.com/cap2UI5/cap2UI5), bundles the
whole backend (framework core + samples) plus the unchanged UI5 frontend
into a static site, and pushes the result to
[web-cap2UI5-build](https://github.com/cap2UI5/web-cap2UI5-build), which
serves it on GitHub Pages (https://cap2ui5.github.io/web-cap2UI5-build/).
Every z2ui5 roundtrip is answered in-process in the browser — no server.

This repo was formerly named `web-cap2UI5`. It holds ONLY tooling: `input/`,
`generated/` and `dist/` are gitignored build state; the built site lives in
web-cap2UI5-build (one commit per deployment).

## Upstream layout (ground truth since the monorepo split, 2026-07)

The mirrored cap2UI5 repo is the app at the **repo root**, with the
framework **vendored at `core/`** (npm package `abap2UI5`):

- framework classes: `core/srv/z2ui5/` (built-ins in `02/`, + `02/01/`)
- bundled samples (flat): `core/srv/app/samples/`
- the app's own custom apps: `srv/app/` (server-only ones like
  `z2ui5_cl_app_read_odata` fail the smoke-require and are skipped — correct)
- webapp: `app/z2ui5/webapp/`
- `paths.mjs`: `CAP_DIR` = the snapshot root (`input/cap2UI5`)

## Files

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `mirror.mjs` | clone/copy the app repo → `input/cap2UI5/` (whole root, minus `.git`/`.github`/`node_modules`); `MIRROR_SOURCE=/path` uses a local checkout |
| `gen-registry.mjs` | smoke-requires every candidate class (anchor: `core/package.json`, so `abap2UI5/...` requires resolve via its exports map) → `generated/registry.mjs` |
| `build.mjs` | esbuild bundle (resolves `abap2UI5/*` by basename over `core/srv`), webapp copy, index.html patch (bundle before UI5 bootstrap, UI5 from CDN) → `dist/` |
| `entry.mjs` | browser entry: register classes, in-memory draft store, fetch interceptor for `*/rest/root/z2ui5` |
| `stubs/` | build-time stand-ins for `@sap/cds`, `fs`, `path`, `crypto` |
| `dev-server.mjs` | local static server (`npm run serve`, port 8080) |
| `live-smoke.mjs` | same smoke suite against the deployed Pages site (`npm run smoke:live`, or any URL via `SMOKE_URL=`) |

Build locally: `npm ci && npm run mirror && npm run build && npm run serve`.
`npm run smoke` opens `dist/` in headless Chromium (Playwright) and asserts
the shell actually renders (bundle active, UI5 booted, startup roundtrip
answered) — CI runs it before every deploy, and after each deploy it waits
for the Pages deploy (polling `BUILD_INFO.json`, written by `build.mjs` —
deterministic, upstream sha only) and reruns the suite against the live URL.
A daily `health` workflow reruns the live smoke on cron to catch new
OpenUI5 CDN releases breaking the deliberately unpinned bootstrap between
deployments. Sourcemaps are not emitted by
default (2 MB per deploy, publishes the full sources); `WEB_SOURCEMAP=1`
opts in locally.

## Invariants

- **`keepNames: true` is load-bearing** (draft serialization keys on
  `constructor.name`).
- Samples that Node loads but esbuild rejects are auto-excluded and the
  bundle retried — that loop only ever removes sample files.
- The registry walk order mirrors the runtime discovery (built-ins →
  bundled samples → `srv/app`), first hit per class name wins.

## Trigger / deploy chain

cap2UI5:`trigger_web` (manual) writes this repo's `UPSTREAM_HEAD` via deploy
key (`ACTION_KEY_WEB` there) → push starts `build web` here (also: weekly
cron + manual) → build → push `dist/` to web-cap2UI5-build via
`BUILT_DEPLOY_KEY` → its `deploy pages` workflow deploys to GitHub Pages.
Never push to web-cap2UI5-build by hand.
